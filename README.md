# user_cars_price_predictor

### Under Construction ### 

My idea is to create an app that will show predicted prices for years from 2005-2015 once car make and model are selected.

The app will have following features:
1. Scraping autotrader.com to gather car details for the price predictor (potentially more websites will be added later).
2. Cleaning up the data automatically once dataset is loaded.
3. Fitting to the ML model and predicting the prices.
4. WebApp with simple UI that allows user to select car make and model, then shows predicted price.

Further enhancements once the above is done:

1. Add delivery costs from car destination to the port in NJ and freight costs to Poland.
2. Scraping Otomoto.pl, a local used cars website for the same, so the prices can be compared.
